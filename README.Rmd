## How to cite the package

Ma, W. & de la Torre, J. (2018). GDINA: The generalized DINA model framework. R package version 2.2. Retrived from https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GDINA

Visit the package website https://wenchao-ma.github.io/GDINA for examples and tutorials.

## Features of the package

*  Estimating G-DINA model and a variety of widely-used models subsumed by the G-DINA model, including the DINA model, DINO model, additive-CDM (A-CDM), linear logistic model (LLM), reduced reparametrized unified model (RRUM), multiple-strategy DINA model for dichotomous responses
*  Estimating models within the G-DINA model framework using user-specified design matrix and link functions
*  Estimating Bugs-DINA, DINO and G-DINA models for dichotomous responses
*  Estimating sequential G-DINA model for ordinal and nominal responses
*  Estimating the diagnostic tree model (experimental)
*  Modelling independent, saturated, higher-order, loglinear smoothed, and structured joint attribute distribution
*  Accommodating multiple-group model analysis
*  Imposing monotonic constrained success probabilities
*  Accommodating binary and polytomous attributes
*  Validating Q-matrix under the general model framework
*  Evaluating absolute and relative item and model fit
*  Comparing models at the test and item levels
*  Detecting differential item functioning using Wald and likelihood ratio test
*  Simulating data based on all aforementioned CDMs
*  Providing graphical user interface for users less familiar with R


## Installation

You can install the development version of GDINA from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Wenchao-Ma/GDINA")
```
