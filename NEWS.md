# GDINA 2.1.7
* Added   - experimental functions for simulating and estimating diagnostic tree model (to be optimized)
* Fixed   - bugs in `dif` function and `startGDINA` function
* Changed - `logLik` function to be consistent with default S3 methods

# GDINA 2.0.7
* bug fixed

# GDINA 2.0
* This is a major update including a large number of new features. The `GDINA` function has been largely rewritten for both flexibility and speed. 
  Users are now allowed to fit `MS-DINA` model, `Bugs` models, and define models by providing design matrix and link functions. For joint attribute
  distribution, in addition to saturated and higher-order models, users are now allowed to fit independent model and loglinear model. Code for 
  joint attribute distribution modelling has been restructured as well. Other major updates include model fit evaluation using M2 statistics and other
  limited information measures, item-level model selection using likelihood ratio test and score test, classification accuracy evaluation indices, 
  bootstrap standard error estimation, etc.
* Note that due to the major updates, some results from this version may be slightly different from those using the previous versions.
